        Description of the GOSH backend for the Latex Beamer Package

                            Ronald Aigner

The style 'beamer.gosh' allows to generate slides from a GOSH file using the
latex-beamer style.  There are some restriction on how to format the text:
* The Beamer style displays short names of the current part of the
  presentation.  For these parts we use the chapter. Therefore use short
  descriptive names with chapters.
* Two chapter titles are reserved: 'Outline' and 'Question'. 
  * Writing a single outline chapter will generate the outline slide in the
    presentation. Leave this chapter empty. Using a dedicated chapter allows
    you to palce the outline wherever you like.
  * Writing a single question chapter will generate a slide with the caption
    "Question" and a centered graphic showing question marks. Per default the
    provided graphic 'question1.pdf' is included. To be able to use this file
    use 'TEXINPUTS=.:$(GOSHDIR)/beamer: pdflatex' instead of 'pdflatex'. You
    can specify an alternative graphic using the '--question' argument.
* To assign the title of a slide, use the section heading.
* You may also use the subsection heading to generate a slide. The main
  difference to a section is the placement in the outline.
* You may use pictures just as you would with the main latex style.
* To generate listings with grayed items where the items are displayed with
  the next click, insert the 'pause' command after an item (Don't forget to
  write the backslash before 'pause'.)
* To use the nice box frames of the beamer package, you can write your
  text in GOSH's paragraph style (by using '-' to underline the title of the
  paragraph.
* Per default a biblioraphy is generated.

Options:
########

You can specify a beamer theme using the '--theme' command line argument.
Default is 'Darmstadt'. For a list of valid theme refer to the latex-beamer
documentation.

To manipulate the look of a theme you may use the command line arguments
'--colortheme', '--fonttheme', '--innertheme, and '--outertheme'. For a list
of valid themes refer to the latex-beamer documentation.

You can also split a them using the '--theme-split' command line argument.
This gives you the possibility to define single elemts of the layout.
*Untested!*

If you specify the '--slidenum' command line argument to let gosh generate a
specific footline with your name, the title of the talk, and your name.

Animated items (see 'pause' command) are per default grayed if not displayed.
You can hide the gayed items if you specify the '--cover-notransparent'
command line argument. Another option is to use '--cover-auto', which will
only display two grayed items.

Use the command line option '--question' to specify an alternative file
containing the question mark graphic.
